# ContactUsExercise

This application contains a home page and contact page with a form. You can access the contact form using `http://localhost:4200/contact`, or use the button in the header.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests. There are basic unit tests to confirm that each component is created, and a test for the PostMessageService to ensure that requests are being sent and with the right body.
